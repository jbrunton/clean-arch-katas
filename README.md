# Clean Architecture Katas

This repository collates katas helpful for practicing Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design.

Note that, since some DDD concepts are only really applicable to large applications with multiple domains (bounded contexts), most of these katas will only provide opportunities for practicing a subset of the technical refactoring techniques.

## Getting started

If you want to practice these using TypeScript, the [node-typescript-template](https://github.com/jbrunton/node-typescript-template) project may be helpful.
